# 2 Api Projects

**[click here to open the project](https://joseriosdev.github.io/2api-projects/)**

Here are my first two projects done using any API. Was such a good challenge and I was guided by my online mentor **[Brad Traversy](https://www.traversymedia.com/)**. The first project was done with a movie app `https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api` and the second with a weather api `https://openweathermap.org/api`.

## What I learned

* Use of promises and "async await"
* REST
* More DOM manipulation
* More good programming practice
* Use of bootstrap
